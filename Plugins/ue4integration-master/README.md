FMOD Studio UE4 Integration
---------------------------
Source for the the UE4 FMOD Studio plugin.  It contains the source code but does
not contain the FMOD libs for any platform. Master branch supports the latest FMOD
and UE4 versions, check branches for previous versions.

This repository is only useful for developers who are building UE4 from source,
or those who wish to rebuild plugin binaries via the command line.

The FMOD libs can be found at http://www.fmod.com/download
either in the official UE4 plugin release, or else the programmers API download.

For more information about the FMOD integration, online documentation is available at
